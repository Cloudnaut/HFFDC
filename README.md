# HFFDC
Huge f\*cking file delta copy

A program which copies huge f\*ucking files without consuming the whole RAM
Further improvments are planed but not implemented yet

Usage:
HFFDC.exe SourceFilePath TargetFilePath BlockSizeInBytes

Note:
Because of lazy coding - Make sure the target file exists already and has exactly the same size as the source file.
Why? Because I just needed backups of my fixed size container files. Should be improved. Placeholder functions already implemented.
